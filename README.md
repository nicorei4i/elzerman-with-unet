# elzerman-with-unet

- denoising to recognize blibs in elzerman traces 
- comparison of the simple convolutional autoencoder and the unet model
- includes slurm scripts to run on high performance cluster 

- create data with 'simulate_elzerman_data.py' 
- train and test models with 'unet_train.py' or 'aenc_train.py'
