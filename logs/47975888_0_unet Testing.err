/home/md334167/elzerman-with-unet/unet_test.py:111: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(15, 5), sharex=True)  # Create a figure with 4 subplots
